**ðŸ˜³ Hello you!**

I'm David Wong. I'm currently a cryptography engineer working on the [Mina cryptocurrency](https://minaprotocol.com/) at [O(1) Labs](https://o1labs.org/). I'm also the author of the book [Real-World Cryptography](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography?a_aid=Realworldcrypto&a_bid=ad500e09).
I used to be the security lead on the [Diem blockchain](https://www.diem.com) (formely known as Libra), working from Novi (Facebook). 
Before that I was a security consultant at [Cryptography Services (NCC Group)](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/). 

You can find more about what I do on my crypto blog [cryptologie.net](https://www.cryptologie.net) or my portfolio [davidwong.fr](https://davidwong.fr).
